// make interpreter... where you match each charactor to a function... 
    //make a dictionary for looking up chars/strings to see which procedure to call
    // list that store pairs that map the operator to the function
    // the list structure can LATER be replaced
    // have the dictionary use the list
    // the dictionary must be agnostic about datastructures (does not show that is uses a list)
    // predefined dictionary
    // other dictionary for user defined functions
